	   <p>
		Descendant. A descendant refers to any element that is connected but lower down the document tree - no matter how many levels lower.<br>
		 elements matched by the second selector are selected if they have an ancestor<br>
		 (parent, parent's parent, parent's parent's parent, etc.) element matching the first selector.

		There were rumors going around before the finale that “Descendants of the Sun”<br>
		 would end with Song Joong Ki's character dying, but thankfully,<br>
		 “Descendants of the Sun” ended with a happy ending, leaving most viewers satisfied.
